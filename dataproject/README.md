## Getting Started

Download the entire folder "Dataproject" to get started.

### Installing

All the extensions you need to install are already included in the code, just run the entire code, and you will not need any other installations. 


## Deployment

Works best if runned in Jupyter, as the extension "ipywidgets" does not work in all environments.

Execute the code for all new sections. The start of a section is indicated by a dropdown and a comment. 

E.g. The beginning of out code should be run as follows:
