## Introduction
In this zip-folder you will find a portfolio containing our Data Analysis Project, Model Analysis Project and Exam Project. 
Furthermore you will find at .txt-file containing documentation for the required peer feedback.

## Data Analysis Project
In our data analysis project, we wish to conduct a graphical analysis of the relationship between unemployment and the number of refugees within different countries. 

All the extensions needed are included in the code, and also no further installations are required.

**Dependencies:** Since the extension **"ipywidgets"** does not work in all environments we recommend running the code in **Jupyter**.

## Model Analysis Project
In this project we examine a model of **Cournot competition with and without collusion**. First, we calculate the Cournot-Nash Equilibrium in a situation with two symmetric firms and no collusion, and afterwardes we extend the model by looking at the scenario where the firms collude. 

Lastly, we look into whether collusion will sustain, and find that it will not, due to prisoner's dilemma.

**Dependencies:** Apart from a standard Anaconda Python 3 installation no further installations are required.



## Exam Project
The structure of the project is equivalent to the structure of the jupyter file provided for the exam. There is a section for each of the three models, where each sub-question is answered in the same order as given.

**Dependencies:** Apart from a standard Anaconda Python 3 installation no further installations are required.
