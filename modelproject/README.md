# Modelproject

Our project is titled **Cournot Competition with and without Collusion** and is about the finding the Cournot Nash-Equilibrium in a situation with two symmetric companies, both with and without collusion. Furthermore, we look into whether a collusion will sustain, and argue that it will not, due to the infamous prisoners dilemma.

The **results** of the project can be seen from running [modelproject.ipynb](modelproject.ipynb).

**Dependencies:** Apart from a standard Anaconda Python 3 installation the project requires no further installations.
