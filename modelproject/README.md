# Modelproject

Our project is titled **Cournot Competition with and without Collusion** and is about finding the Cournot Nash-Equilibrium in a situation with two symmetric companies. We look at two different scenarios the case where the two companies to not collude, and the case where they do. Furthermore, we look into whether a collusion will sustain, and argue that it will not, due to the infamous prisoners dilemma.

The **results** of the project can be seen from running [modelproject.ipynb](modelproject.ipynb).

**Dependencies:** Apart from a standard Anaconda Python 3 installation the project requires no further installations.
